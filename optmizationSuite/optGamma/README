Overview:
	Optimize the beam energy for an free-electron laser. The script
	<em>optgamma_p.sh</em> is designed for parameters setup. Energy 
	scanning range in rest energy (gamma = (Energy in MeV)/0.511),
	including begin value, end value and step values, all are integers;
	and factor ratio (also an integer) required to be divided by the 
	input integers to get the true float values, these are all shell
	scripting tricks in dealing with arithmetical calculation. 
	Input file name also should be defined in <em>optgamma_p.sh</em>.
	After that, <em>optgamma_p.sh</em> would distribute the whole work
	to multithreaded workers, by default all CPU cores would be called.

	Script <em>optgamma.sh</em> is the main functional procedure for 
	gamma optimization, the input parameters would be transferred from
	the main script <em>optgamma_p.sh</em>, all the workers would start
	to work.

	When all the workers finished the job, main script <em>optgamma_p.sh</em>
	would collect all the results data and merge into single file as the
	final result. Further the optimized gamma value would be figured out
	and substitute the value in the input file.
